Inhibition of WEE1, a DNA damage response kinase, drives cancer cells into mitosis without being able to repair damaged DNA, resulting in cell death. Currently, there are no FDA-approved WEE1 inhibitors, and we have designed Azenosertib to have advantages over other investigational therapies, including superior selectivity and pharmacokinetic properties.Azenosertib is being developed in three therapeutic settings of high unmet need:As a monotherapyTETON: Phase 2 Monotherapy Study in Uterine Serous CarcinomaDENALI: Phase 2 Monotherapy Study in Cyclin E1 Driven High Grade Serous Ovarian CancerPhase 1 Monotherapy Dose Optimization Study in Solid TumorsIn combination with traditional chemotherapy and DNA damaging agentsMAMMOTH: Phase 2 Combination Study of Azenosertib and PARPi in PARP Resistant Ovarian CancerPhase 1b/2 Combination Study of Azenosertib and Chemotherapy in Ovarian CancerPhase 1/2 Combination Study of Azenosertib and Gemcitabine in OsteosarcomaIn combination with molecularly targeted agentsThe Company is collaborating with Pfizer on a Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of azenosertib in combination with encorafenib and cetuximab in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated colorectal cancer.

Currently, Zentalisâ clinical product candidates are in clinical development, not yet approved by health authorities, such as the U.S. FDA, and therefore are âinvestigational drugs.â This phase of development means that more clinical studies are required and that health authorities have not yet found these products to be safe and effective for their specific use.It is the FDAâs position that, whenever possible, an investigational drug should be used as part of a clinical trial. Therefore, Zentalis clinical trial programs are the primary way to access our investigational drugs prior to regulatory approval and we encourage patients to speak with their doctors to determine potential benefits, risks and eligibility to participate in such a clinical trial.Where enrollment in a clinical trial is not an option, patients with serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions who have exhausted all other treatment options may receive investigational drug through another option commonly known as âExpanded Accessâ or âCompassionate Useâ.Per the FDA, Expanded Access may be appropriate when the below criteria are met:Patient has a serious disease or condition, or whose life is immediately threatened.There is no similar or satisfactory alternative therapy to diagnose, monitor or treat the disease or condition.Enrollment in a clinical trial is not possible.Possible patient benefit justifies the possible risks of treatment with investigational drugs.Providing the investigational medical product will not affect the investigational trials.Generally, Zentalis does not provide investigational drugs to patients until there is sufficient data on the safety and efficacy of our products to allow patients and physicians to assess the risks and benefits of using these investigational drugs outside of a clinical trial context. Therefore, after careful consideration, Zentalis is not currently offering Expanded Access to investigational drugs.In the future, Expanded Access may be reassessed for each of Zentalisâ investigational drugs as these advance further in clinical trials and more data to support the safety and effectiveness become available.Posting this policy by Zentalis does not guarantee access to any specific investigational drug for any individual patient.You can find additional information about Zentalisâ ongoing clinical trials on our website and by accessing .If you have additional questions, please speak with your treating physician or contact Zentalis at at .Science Center10275 Science Center DriveSuite 200San Diego, CA 92121Copyright Â© 2024 Zentalis Pharmaceuticals.All Rights Reserved.AboutÂ Uspipelineour approachinvestors\n","About UsOur CompanyOur PipelinePipelineOur ApproachInvestors &Â MediaInvestors & MediaNews & EventsStock InformationFinancials &Â FilingsCorporate GovernanceInvestor ResourcesCareersPrivacy PolicyZentalis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

For founder Martyn Gross, that vision was personal. He had experienced excellent results using UVB therapy to treat his psoriasis, but found that visiting his dermatologist three times a week for in-office treatment was totally unsustainable. Why wasnt there an effective way to treat chronic skin conditions without all the tradeoffs? He founded Zerigo Health to change that.\n","For too long, treating chronic skin conditions like psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo has come with frustrating tradeoffs: Either you make multiple visits to your dermatologist for phototherapy treatment every week, or your condition flares up; either you endure the safety risks and side effects of biologic treatments or you suffer with painful, embarrassing skin legions; either you cover expensive treatments that drive up premiums for everyone, or you leave 10% of your population out in the cold.\n","The treatment tradeoffs have left gaps in our healthcare system that has ripple effects beyond the dermatology industry. Nearly one in ten people suffer from chronic autoimmune skin conditions that impair not only their physical health, but also their emotional well-being and even their ability to perform their jobs. Standard drug treatments cost payers over $20B annuallyand those costs are only growing.\n","Zerigo is counteracting that ripple effect by reinventing how care is delivered. Our mission is to empower people with chronic skin conditions and remove waste from the healthcare system by providing easy access to the most effective care. Our safe, at-home phototherapy solutions deliver on that mission by giving members an effective way to achieve clear skin, while significantly reducing costs for employers and health plansin turn, lowering premiums and healthcare costs for everyone.\n","Together, with our members and partners, were creating the future of care delivery for chronic skin conditions.\n","Our Leadership\n","Our team of healthcare veterans, physicians, engineers, and advisors are dedicated to creating products and services that support people with chronic skin conditions and the clinicians who care for them.\n","Lisa Rometty\n","President and CEO\n","As President and CEO of Zerigo Health, Lisa brings over 30 years of global leadership experience, excelling in driving growth, operational excellence, and customer-focused innovation.

Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit filed in civil court.There is no judge or jury in an arbitration.Instead, the dispute is heard and resolved by a neutral arbitrator.Court review of an arbitration award is limited.Except to the extent the parties agree otherwise, arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award.\n","16.3.2. You agree that the U.S.Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision, and that You and Zerigo are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action lawsuit.This arbitration provision will survive any termination of these Terms.\n","16.3.3. If You wish to begin an arbitration proceeding, after following the informal dispute resolution procedure, you must send a letter requesting arbitration and describing Your claim to Zerigo at: 12651 High Bluff Drive, Suite 300, San Diego CA 92130.

Payment of all filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be governed by the JAMS rules.If You are an individual and have not accessed or used the Services on behalf of an entity, we will reimburse those fees for claims totaling less than $10,000 unless the arbitrator determines the claims are frivolous, and we will not seek attorneys fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator determines that the claims are frivolous.\n","16.3.6.

Any claim that all or part of this Class Action Waiver is unenforceable, unconscionable, void, or voidable may be determined only by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an arbitrator. The parties understand that any right to litigate a claim, case, or grievance in court, to have a judge or jury decide their case, or to be a party to a class or representative action, is waived and that any claims must be decided individually, through arbitration.If this class action waiver is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of the Arbitration Agreement, if otherwise effective, will be null and void.The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party's individual claim.If, for any reason, a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration, You and Zerigo each waive any right to a jury trial.\n","17. GENERAL PROVISIONS.\n","17.1. Entire Agreement. These Terms constitute the complete agreement between You and Zerigo and supersede all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, written or oral, with respect to the subject matter discussed herein.\n","17.2. Export Laws. You agree that You will not export or re-export , directly or indirectly the Products or Services and/or other information or materials provided by Zerigo hereunder, to any country for which the United States or any other relevant jurisdiction requires any export license or other governmental approval at the time of export of such device, software, or data without first obtaining such license, approval or other applicable license exemption or exception.In particular, but without limitation, the Services may not be exported or re-exported\n","17.2.1. into any U.S.embargoed countries or any country that has been designated by the U.S.Government as a terrorist supporting country, or\n","17.2.2. to anyone listed on any U.S.Government list of prohibited or restricted parties, including the U.S.Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S.Department of Commerce Denied Persons List or Entity List.By using the Services, you represent and warrant that You are not located in any such country or included on any such list.You also agree that You will not use these products for any purposes prohibited by United States law, including, without limitation, the development, design, manufacture, or production of nuclear, missiles, or chemical or biological weapons.You are responsible for and hereby agree to comply, at Your sole expense, with all applicable United States export laws and regulations.\n","17.3. Injunctive Relief. You agree that a breach of these Terms will cause irreparable injury to Zerigo for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and Zerigo shall be entitled to seek equitable relief in addition to any remedies it may have hereunder or at law without posting a bond, other security, or proof of damages.\n","17.4. Miscellaneous. These Terms will inure to the benefit of, and will be binding upon, each partys successors and assigns.These Terms and the licenses granted hereunder may be assigned by Zerigo, but may not be assigned by You, without the prior express written consent of Zerigo.If any provision hereof is or becomes, at any time or for any reason, unenforceable or invalid, no other provision hereof will be affected thereby, and the remaining provisions will continue with the same effect as if such unenforceable or invalid provisions will not have been inserted herein; provided that the ability of either party to obtain substantially the bargained-for performance of the other will not have thereby been impaired.It is expressly understood that in the event either party on any occasion fails to perform any term hereof, and the other party does not enforce that term, the failure to enforce on any occasion will not constitute a waiver of any term and will not prevent enforcement on any other occasion.Nothing contained in these Terms will be deemed to constitute a designation of either party as the agent or representative of the other party or both parties as joint venturers or partners for any purpose.The headings and captions contained herein will not be considered part of the Terms but are for convenience only.You and Zerigo agree that the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the interpretation or construction of these Terms.

In fact, the efficacy of NB-UVB phototherapy has been supported by 25+ years of clinical data demonstrating its success as a treatment for psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, and vitiligo1. Despite its long history of efficacy, traditional treatment plans require patients to make multiple visits to a clinic per week, making it an inconvenient and unsustainable option for most people.

The Zerigo device protects your skin from unnecessary UV exposure by delivering highly targeted treatment with therapeutically beneficial wavelengths of light2.\n","How Zerigo Stacks Up Against Other Treatments\n","Treatment for chronic skin conditions usually involves some combination of topical creams, advanced pharmaceuticals, in-clinic phototherapy booths, and lifestyle changes.\n","Convenience\n","The common treatments for chronic skin disease either require multiple, daily, applications of messy creams. Or they require frequent clinic visits. Side-effects from medications often lead to even more appointments and greater hassle. Zerigo offers on-the-go convenience without the time commitment or side-effects.\n","Affordability\n","Advanced therapies like biologic drugs can be effective, but their high price tag makes them an unsustainable option for many, even with insurance coverage. Biosimilar drugs may be more affordable, but still carry higher price tags and co-pays, and often are not covered by insurance. The Zerigo Skin Health Program is available at no cost3 when offered as part of your health plan.\n","Efficacy\n","Treating chronic skin conditions with topical prescriptions and pharmaceutical therapies can be a scattershot experience that leaves many feeling hopeless. For many, these treatments are initially effective, but produce diminishing results over time.

This policy is intended to give security researchers clear guidelines for conducting vulnerability discovery activities and to convey our preferences in how to submit discovered vulnerabilities to Zerigo.\n","Scope\n","This Vulnerability Disclosure policy aims to ensure a consistent and secure manner in which individuals (e.g., security researchers) may communicate suspected vulnerability to Zerigo products or services. Zerigo is committed to continually improving our organization's security and, more specifically, our information assets security. The responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy of our users.\n","This vulnerability disclosure policy applies to any vulnerabilities internal or external parties consider reporting to Zerigo.\n","It is recommended to read this vulnerability disclosure policy fully before reporting a vulnerability and always acting in compliance with it.\n","Zerigo values and thanks those who take the time and effort to report security vulnerabilities according to this policy.

Vulnerability reports might take some time to triage or address. You are welcome to inquire on the status but avoid doing so more than once every 14 days. This allows our teams to focus on the curative action.\n","We will notify you when the reported vulnerability is remediated, and you may be invited to confirm that the solution covers the vulnerability adequately.\n","Once your reported vulnerability has been resolved, we welcome requests to disclose your report.

Those with relatively small, scattered areas of involvement or who want additional control for problem areas when taking combination therapies may be suited for the Zerigo Health Solution.\n","Our handheld, targeted device is designed to deliver a precise dose of therapeutic light to affected areas and to minimize the treatment of unaffected skin. The total surface area for each treatment is a square with each side measuring about 2 inches. Treatments may require from seconds to minutes to deliver, depending on your skin color, diagnosis, and the stage of your therapy.\n","You must be able to reach your treatment areas or have someone who can help you. Familiarity with smartphones helps with the initial system setup but is not necessary. ZerigoCare Guides are here to help you.\n","WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF AT HOME TREATMENT VERSUS IN-CLINIC CARE?\n","Home treatment can be done any time of day and according to your personal schedule. If you need to change to a later time of day, you can! Your Zerigo Health Home Phototherapy Device is also very compact and easy to take with you when traveling.\n","CAN I COMBINE LIGHT THERAPY WITH MY OTHER MEDICATIONS?\n","Your prescribing physician will determine if you have any contraindications to light therapy or need dose adjustments to account for your medications. ZerigoCare Guides are very familiar with the treatments associated with skin conditions like yours. They will work together with you and your physician to ensure optimal treatment safety and efficacy.\n","WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF PHOTOTHERAPY?\n","Although the safety features and targeted nature of the handheld device helps to minimize unwanted side effects, phototherapy does come with some risks. The most common short-term side effects are tanning, hyperpigmentation, skin texture changes, and in some rare instances, scar formation. These changes can often be alleviated or prevented with careful, observant care. Increased incidence of skin cancers in patients who have received NB-UVB therapy has not yet been established; however, only a limited number of large studies have looked at the long-term effects of NB-UVB on chronic skin conditions. As a result, the risks and benefits of light therapy must be weighed by you with your physician. Chronic exposure to UV light can damage the eyes. Thus, it is important to wear the Zerigo-provided safety eyewear during each treatment session.\n","ARE THERE CONTRAINDICATIONS TO PHOTOTHERAPY?\n","Although there are few absolute contraindications to phototherapy, such as history of light sensitivity and genetic skin cancer conditions, relative contraindications include a history of skin cancer and poor response to phototherapy. Risks of treatment should be discussed with your physician, especially if you have lighter skin, are taking a medication associated with sunsensitivity, and/or are taking immunosuppressive agents (such as Azathioprine and Cyclosporine) that can markedly increase the risks of UV-related skin cancer.\n","HOW LONG IS THE TREATMENT TIME?\n","We recommend contacting your doctor to determine if you may be a good candidate. When scheduling an appointment, we recommend requesting an evaluation for home UVB therapy. If your physician is very familiar with your situation, he or she may be comfortable prescribing the Zerigo Health Solution immediately. Should you need assistance, were happy to reach out to your physician on your behalf. If you do not have a doctor, we can also help you to find a prescribing physician.\n","WHAT IF MY SKIN CONDITION DOES NOT IMPROVE WITH HOME LIGHT THERAPY?\n","Unfortunately, no treatment is effective for all patients. Together, you and your doctor can decide the best course of action if it is determined you do not respond to phototherapy\n","HAS THIS DEVICE BEEN CLEARED BY THE FDA AND WHAT ARE THE INDICATIONS FOR USE?\n","Yes! The Zerigo Health Solution received FDA clearance on May 23, 2017. It is an Ultraviolet Light Emitting Medical Device intended for use in localized phototherapeutic treatment of dermatologic conditions such as psoriasis, vitiligo, atopic dermatitis (eczema), seborrheic dermatitis, and leukoderma on all skin types (I-VI).\n","WILL MY HEALTH CARE INSURANCE PAY FOR THE ZERIGO HEALTH SOLUTION?\n","The Zerigo Health Solution may be provided at no cost to you through your employer health plan. Additionally, many insurers offer reimbursement for home phototherapy equipment, depending on the diagnosis, medical history, and individual coverage policies.\n","Returns\n","IS THE SYSTEM COVERED BY A WARRANTY?\n","Yes, there is a one-year warranty that covers the device and software for manufacturers defects.\n","CAN I RETURN MY DEVICE?\n","If your device has stopped working and is still under warranty, please contact us for troubleshooting assistance. If we find that your device is defective and within the warranty period, we will issue a replacement device within 7 days of receiving the defective device. If the root cause is determined to be a software defect, we will address the defect with a patch within a reasonable time frame.\n","If your device is covered by insurance, any confirmed malfunction will be replaced at no cost.\n","If the failure is determined to be caused by the user or is otherwise outside of the scope of the warranty, there may be a charge for a replacement device.\n","Contact Zerigo Health Patient Support at  or 877-738-6041 if you have any questions.\n","Device\n","HOW LARGE IS THE DEVICE TREATMENT AREA?\n","The total treatment surface is a square with each side measuring about 2 inches.\n","WHAT IF MY DEVICE BREAKS OR DOESNT WORK?\n","Support is available to help troubleshoot or assist in replacement or repair when necessary.\n","ARE THERE REPLACEABLE PARTS OR MAINTENANCE REQUIRED?\n","No replacement parts or maintenance is required.\n","CAN I SHARE MY DEVICE WITH A FAMILY MEMBER?\n","The device will only function with your personal prescription.\n","Mobile App\n","WHAT ARE THE PHONE REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT THE ZERIGO HEALTH MOBILE APP AND DEVICE?\n","The most recent versions of Android (Version 10.0+) and iPhone iOS (Version 13.0+) are supported. Your phone must have at least 50 MB of available storage\n","WHY MUST I DOWNLOAD THE ZERIGO HEALTH MOBILE APP?\n","The Zerigo Health Mobile App is the connection between your physicians prescription and the Zerigo Health handheld device. It assures that the dosage and frequency your doctor prescribes govern the performance of the system. It also unlocks secure access to personalized phototherapy education, treatment, and ZerigoCare Guide support services.\n","CAN THE ZERIGO HEALTH HANDHELD ACT INDEPENDENTLY OF THE MOBILE APP?\n","No, the Zerigo Health Home Phototherapy Device is a part of a connected treatment management and monitoring system that requires connection to the Mobile App\n","HOW IS MY INFORMATION KEPT CONFIDENTIAL?\n","All patient data is encrypted when it is transferred or stored using procedures that conform with HIPAA privacy and security standards.

(Zerigo Health or the Company) has adopted a Comprehensive Compliance Program (Compliance Program) consistent with guidance published by the Office of the Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (the OIG). Zerigo Health's Compliance Program is intended to provide guidance for Company interactions with healthcare professionals, promote the prevention and resolution of actual or apparent conflicts of interest, ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, and provide process for reporting of violations of the Company's policies relating to the sale and marketing of the Company's products. All Zerigo Health employees, officers, directors, and agents (Team Members) must comply with Company policies and procedures as well as all laws, rules and regulations of the U.S. and the states, counties, cities and other jurisdictions applicable to the Company's sale or marketing of its products.\n","COMPREHENSIVE COMPLIANCE PROGRAM SUMMARY\n","The OIG advises that an effective compliance program is comprised of seven elements. Zerigo Health has used these seven elements as a basis for its Compliance Program. Fundamental elements of our Compliance Program are summarized below.\n","Written Policies and Procedures: Zerigo Health has ratified a Code of Ethical Conduct and has adopted the AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals as the Companys primary statement of policies for assuring compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards governing the marketing and promotion of Zerigo Healths products. To the best of its ability and consistent with the OIGs guidance regarding tailoring compliance programs to the nature of Zerigo Healths business as a medical device company, the Company also has incorporated into its policies and procedures additional requirements of federal and/or state laws.\n","Compliance Leadership: Zerigo Health has designated a Compliance Officer (the Compliance Officer). The Compliance Officer is empowered to exercise independent judgment and is responsible for developing, monitoring and otherwise administrating the Compliance Program. The Company also has appointed a Compliance Committee comprised of the Compliance Officer and members of the Companys senior management to assist the Compliance Officer with review, revision and implementation of the Compliance Program to meet legal and regulatory requirements applicable to the Company.\n","Education and Training: The Company trains Team Members on the Code of Conduct, on the legal and ethical obligations for Zerigo Health Team Members, and Company policies and procedures concerning the Companys products.\n","Communication: Zerigo Health has adopted open-door, confidentiality (to the extent possible) and non-retaliation policies in the event a Team Member is concerned about a potential violation of the Companys Code of Conduct. Team Members may also use the Companys anonymous Integrity Hotline at 1-833-833-1319 to report suspected violations of Company policies or the Code of Conduct.\n","Auditing and Monitoring: The Compliance Officer is responsible for auditing and monitoring compliance with Company policies and procedures.\n","Enforcement and Appropriate Disciplinary Action: All reported potential violations shall be reported to the Integrity Hotline or forwarded to the Compliance Officer.\n","Corrective Action Procedures: As needed and on an ongoing basis, the Compliance Officer will assess the need to revise policies, procedures, training, communication or other elements of Zerigo Healths Compliance Program.\n","REPORTING OF VIOLATIONS; NO RETALIATION\n","Any Team Member who suspects a violation of the Company Code of Conduct, financial fraud, or other violations of Company policy should promptly contact the Compliance Officer or Company management.

The Company will not permit retaliation of any kind by, or on behalf of, the Company or its Team Members against good faith reports or complaints of potential policy violations.\n","DECLARATION OF COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA LAW\n","California Health & Safety Code § 119402 requires certain medical device manufacturers to develop a Comprehensive Compliance Program for interactions with healthcare professionals. Zerigo Health has tailored its Compliance Program to the nature of its business as a medical device company. While § 119402 references the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (PhRMA Code), Zerigo Health has adopted policies and procedures for compliance which are based on the AdvaMed Code of Ethics on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals, adopted by the Advanced Medical Technology Association (the AdvaMed Code), which is similar to the PhRMA Code but is written for medical device companies. To the best of its knowledge, as of the date of this declaration, Zerigo Health is in compliance with California Health & Safety Code §§ 119402 and the Companys Compliance Program.
