WebsiteBatchSynopsis is a tool that enables automated batch distillantion of a list of websites through LLMs driven by the llama.cpp interface. Put simply you can 'ask' any question about a given list of websites and the LLM will loop through each one and attempt to answer the question. For example a query of 'are there any jobs available?' with a list of company websites should output an answer for each website. WARNING: the tool is currently in very early development. It technically works given a very specific prearranged configuration but is otherwise untested and probably will not work for anyone else without a fair bit of technical knowledge to set it up properly.
